My journey is long and encompasses various fields from Engineering to Tech.
I received my BSc. degree from the American University in Cairo in 
Mech Engineering & Minor in Business Admin with High Honors. 
Afterwards, I pursued and an then received an MSc. from TU Berlin in Solar Energy Engineering. 
3 years of experience in the field later, I switched career to cope with the current 
direction towards Tech. Since 2019 I've been working as a Full-Time developer in Berlin. 
I have also managed to complete a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp with ESMT Berlin 
and seek to find opportunities that will help me grow even further.
